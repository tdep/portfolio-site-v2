## Portfolio Website V2

Here is my portfolio website! A living webpage that features projects that I have been working on, my past experience, a little about me, and my links!

It will be updated periodically with newer and better-er projects, stylings, layouts and more features! Always more features!

Currently it is being hosted using Firebase and can be accessed at trevordepew.com!

This is the third iteration, the first was a build that I was working on to figure out what I wanted to do. The second was an app created using Vite and GitHub Pages, but I ran into a number of issues that were taking too much time. So we have this version using Create React App and Firebase!

To run locally, just use `npm run dev` in the root folder and you're good to go.
