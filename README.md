## Portfolio Website V2

### **This has now been superseded by my Portfolio Website V4 found [here](https://github.com/tdep/trevordepew.com)!**

#### About
Here is my (original) portfolio website! A living webpage that features projects that I have been working on, my past experience, a little about me, and my links!



The focus here was in designing something that would tell a story with the content I wanted in my portfolio, while conveying a sense of personal style and interests. 
I built it using vanilla CSS as I had done with previous projects like the [Sequenzer](https://github.com/tdep/Sequinzer-6001-2a) and [TadLab](https://github.com/tdep/tadlab).
Originally hosted using Firebase as a static webpage before I replaced the whole thing with a dyncamically loaded, Java Backend-served fancy-pants full-stack version found [here](https://github.com/tdep/tdep-tadlab-api) and [here](https://github.com/tdep/tdep-tadlab-client).

This is the third iteration, the first was a build that I was working on to figure out what I wanted to do. The second was an app created using Vite and GitHub Pages, but I ran into a number of issues that were taking too much time. So we have this version using Create React App and Firebase!

#### To Run
To run locally, just use `npm run dev` in the root folder and you're good to go.
